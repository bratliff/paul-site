<p dir="ltr"><strong>Daily Ordinary Joy</strong> is an open-ended research project devoted to exploring a hypothesized facet of experience: the momentary sense of joy or delight experienced in the course of everyday life sparked by an encounter with the world. The project seeks to inspire thought about the possibility of using research with an embedded point of view as a generative tool in experience design, and as a way of sensitizing clients to the possibilities for humor, mystery, surprise and play  how they engage their consumers. Below are some moments from the research.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Ritualized.</strong>
		<blockquote>Good coffee</blockquote>
		<p dir="ltr">I allow myself, have decided to allow myself, individual delights in things that I consume. One is: I start each day with the best cup of coffee I can have. This is a bag of coffee from a store way the hell at the other end of Manhattan, in Little Italy. One store. Best coffee in a city. I received two bags of the stuff for Father’s Day. I get up before everyone else and I grind this between two couch pillows so as not to wake others. It is really good. it is not particularly cheap, although (here’s the rationalization) if you get the most expensive bag of coffee you can find, and brew all the cups you can from it, or you buy the same number of cups from a street vendor every day, which will be more?</p>	
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Explainably Pleasurable.</strong>
		<blockquote>Dordrecht Bicycle</blockquote>
		<p dir="ltr">This is a bicycle I photographed in Dordrecht, Netherlands, early in the summer of 2010. It’s a very simple machine. Only the simplest of moving parts, nothing hidden, almost nothing to break down, and what can break down is easy to fix (intuitive to diagnose, doesn’t require many tools). It does what a bicycle does (with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of durability. I guess that’s what makes it beautiful to me. Plus something about the proportions, the fore and aft racks, the big fat tires, and the handlebars that rise up to meet the rider where she sits. I can tell looking at it that it’s a joy to ride. It’s a product with no secrets, and so almost nothing to make it valuable, over and above its intrinsic value as a bicycle.</p>	
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Unexplainably Pleasurable.</strong>
		<blockquote>Ducks on the Stairs</blockquote>
		<p dir="ltr">This morning I walked to the coffee shop via the long stairway that is a pedestrian shortcut down from our house, and at the bottom of the stairs I found five rubber ducks assembled there as if they’d shown up on their own. No one else around. Then two hours later I came back to the same stairs to see that the ducks had organized, elected a leader and were having a rally. I love this. The impulse to put ducks on the stair, to inject a little bit of absurdity into someone else’s day, someone you don’t even know - you, random person on the stairs - seems to me to be a small act of cosmic generosity.  And then there’s the silent conversation, not just conversation, but variations on a theme. This offering in play to strangers, and strangers quietly riffing through an absurd group of objects on the street: that’s what I like.  Also that this thing is both intimate and public. Kind of like the staircase itself.</p>

		<strong>Unexpected.</strong>
		<blockquote>Umbrella Graveyard</blockquote>
		<p dir="ltr">Wasn’t yesterday’s weather the crappiest? The moment I opened my new umbrella, the wind inverted it and rudely tore the piece of poop from my wet fingers. But before i could shake my fist at the sky I spotted this trash bin FILLED with other crappy umbrellas, reminding me to “Keep New York City Clean.” And so I retrieved my dead shelter and dropped it in with the rest. Every trash bin I passed yesterday had dead umbrellas in it and I saw at least 4 other people give up, throw their umbrella away and give in to the rain, the day, the city. Every now and then the challenges of living make me feel so bound to my fellow man that I don’t even begrudge the challenge. Especially in New York, this wonderful/terrible city that rips the umbrella right out of your hand in the middle of the pouring rain.</p>	
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Oddly beautiful.</strong>
		<blockquote>Rhythm, Red</blockquote>
		<p dir="ltr">. . . the rhyme of the puckles and holes and rivets, the rhyme of the long horizontal shapes, the contrast of the fleshness and the thin, hammered steel, the fishermen around us so busy and kind and un-selfconscious, being in Tokyo’s Tsukiji fish market at 4:30 in the morning and looking forward to a breakfast of the freshest sushi we had ever had . . .</p>	
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Familiar.</strong>
		<blockquote>Shiny Pretty Pots</blockquote>
		<p dir="ltr">These are the 1st pots I bought myself (not hand me downs or super heavy industrial strength remnants of marriage) and I love them. I love how shiny they are. I use at least one daily and get a thrill every time. It’s my pot! I get to keep it sparkling! It feels like me treating me, I feel little pops of exuberance when I see them, I know I can take care of me, give me what’s good and joyous for me -- physically (food) and emotionally (things I like!) Self reliance and self worth mixed with silvery zest.</p>	
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Surprising.</strong>
		<blockquote>Strawberry Face</blockquote>
		<p dir="ltr">As soon as I decided that the bump looked like a nose, the rest fell into place, the fat cheeks, the wild green hair. I didn’t eat it for a while but then I thought, what am I gonna do, build a shrine? It was funny, then it was delicious.</p>	
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Accidental.</strong>
		<blockquote>Who Gets Saved First</blockquote>
		<p dir="ltr">The juxtaposition of the two signs sparked a daydream as I wondered home from work: Jesus had returned and elected to begin saving souls in Paddington as an immediate priority. Was it that they were the most in need of saving? Was it that they were already closest to God so it was the easiest place to start, get some fast positive statistics? How had the local paper got hold of the news? Was this their scoop or already being broadcast by every major news outlet? Who knew, but thank God he’d started...</p>
